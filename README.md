# Simple-RL-Jax

Some bare bones implementations of standard reinforcement learning algorithms that use Flax/Jax.


Currently there is a simple REINFORCE JAX implementation based off of PyTorch's RL examples in pytorch.

There is also a simple Actor-Critic / Vanilla Policy Gradient with Baseline implementation in Jax as well.
